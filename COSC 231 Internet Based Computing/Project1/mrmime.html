				<p class="titleList">Evolution:</p>

					&emsp;All Mr. Mimes begin life as <a target="_blank" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mime_Jr._(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Mime Jr</a>. which is a smaller, baby-like, and very playful version of Mr. Mime. A <a target="_blank" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mime_Jr._(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Mime Jr</a>. can only evolve into a Mr. Mime when he has finally learned the move "mimic," which is one of their signiature moves.

					<li>The Drowzee Evolution Line - They are both very intelligent, psychic, and humanoid.</li>
					<li>The Meditite Evolution Line - They are both intelligent, psychic, and humanoid. However, the Meditite line is also particularly good at physical fighting, which Mr. Mime isn't.</li>

				<p class="titleList">Powers:</p>
				<ul class="about">
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mimic_(move)">Mimic</a> - Mr Mime's Signiature Move - He perfectly copies an enemies attack.</li>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Psychic_(move)">Psychic</a> - A common yet very powerful psychic-type move, can also lower his target's defense.</li>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Confusion_(move)">Confusion </a> - Deals moderate damage, and can confuse the enemy into damaging themselves.</li>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Baton_Pass_(move)">Baton Pass</a> - A non-damaging technique that let's Mr. Mime quickly tag in another Pokemon.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="titleList">Strength:</p>
				<p class="inBox">
					&emsp;Mr. Mimes strengths are his Special Attack and Special Defence, which allow him to deal a lot and block a lot of non-physical damage. Mr. Mime is capable of dealing a lot of damage, while still providing a lot of utility. He is very tricky and cunning as an opponent.

					<p class="titleSub">Weaknesses</p>
					<p class="titleList">Weaknesses:</p>
					<p class="inBox">
						&emsp;Mr. Mime has poor attack and defense, so he is particularly vulnerable to physically attacking pokemon. Furthermore, as a psychic and fairy type, Mr. Mime takes double damage from the pokemon types listed below.
					</p>
					<p class="titleList">Pokemon Types That Counter Mr. Mime:</p>
					<ul class="about">
						<li>Poison</li>
						<li>Steel</li>
						<li>Ghost</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="inBox">
						&emsp;We suggest trying to confuse these types of Pokemon, or if necessary, escape with baton pass to a Pokemon who is more suited to defeat that particular enemy. Mr. Mime can easily defeat Pokemon that counter him, it just requires experience and finesse.
