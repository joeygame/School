				<p class="titleList">Mission Statement:</p>
				<p class="inBox">
					&emsp;We here at the Mr. Mime Club firmly believe that this wonderful pokemon should be treated as if he was human, this is due to their very high intelligence and humanoid body structures. In-fact history has shown that Mr. Mimes are smarter, stronger, and more caring that humans.<br>
				</p>
				<p class="inBox">
					&emsp;Furthermore, we want to help trainers who have formed partnerships with Mr. Mimes train. We do so by providing lessons and textbooks on Mr. Mime's battling techniques. Mr. Mimes who have been trained with our program have won many tournaments.
				</p>
				<p class="titleList">Goals:</p>
				<ul class="about">
					<li>Raise awareness of Mr. Mime's status as the most intelligent Pokemon.</li>
					<li>Create Change Socially and Legally for the Treatment of Mr. Mimes as Humans.</li>
					<li>Close the Mr. Mime wage gap.</li>
					<li>Help and sponsor trainers who have partnered with Mr. Mime.</li>
				</ul>
